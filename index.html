    <h4>Chinese married to a Korean husband, I am raising a third culture child and trying to expose her to the best of
      all
      the worlds. Born in Hong Kong and raised on Guam, I lived in the Bay Area all of my adult life. Living so closed
      to
      Scilicon Valley, it is inevitable that I have been touched by the tech industry in all aspects of my life. It is
      also inevitable that my career in meetings and conventions had sent me on furlough, due to the Covid
      pandemic.
      So, here I am, opening the door and braving myself into a brand new world of coding.</p>

      <h3 class="details">My skills.</h3>
      <p class="details">I am forever grateful to technologies. My first coding experience is with Hack Reactor's prep
        program, but it wasn't enough for me to get into this prestigious school of coding. With my friend's suggestion,
        I
        turned to Udemy. I have finished the web development course by Cole Steele and Angela Yu and learned all the
        basics to start off in this industry. Hopefully, I will will be able to complete the a coding
        boot camp and really kick start my programming career. Here are the skills I am working on:

      <h3 class="details">My hobbies.</h3>
      <p class="details">I love eating, therefore, I love cooking. Since the pandemic, I have been cooking a bunch of
        random stuff that I have never attempted to cook before, from scumptious homemade pho to the perfectly crisp
        choux
        au Craqulin. The love of outdoor activies have also kept me busy. I don't mean to brag, but the geographic
        landscape and weather in the Bay Area, makes the outdoor much more fun. I love taking my daughter to explore the
        beaches, mountains, and woods. The snowy Sierra slope is one of my favorite spots. Nothing beats the joy of
        sliding down the
        slushy slope with the gorgeous Lake Tahoe as the backdrop. On any given weekend, I would be on my bike trailing
        the
        bay or sit along one of the coastal piers dangling my fishing pole with my daughter and husband.</p>

      <h3 class="details">My values.</h3>
      <p class="details">Ever since I gave birth to my daughter, nothing
        means more to me than family. Growing up as an immigrant, I lived in a household that consists of three
        families,
        that's 6 adults and 8 kids, plus grandparents as occasional long term visitors. I know all about the importance
        of
        family, but when I turn the age for college, all I wanted is to be away from my family. Now that I am double the
        age
        since I left home, I wished I could have live closer to home, so my daughter could experience what I had
        experienced
        growing up --- it wasn't easy for 14 people to live in a house with three bedrooms.
        To compensate not
        having my family
        around, I started to focus on my daughter's educational development and also my own development. During the
        months
        when school was canceled (due to covid), I became my daugther's teacher. I was so grateful for this percious
        opportunity to see her
        grow during the most important age in her life. Not only do I see her grow, but I also grow with her. I took a
        Korean class, so I can teach her Korean. I am learning to code now, hopefully one day I can steer her into a
        path
        of the future.</p>
